# Plant-Species-Images-Classification
Laboratory Work 2-A Activity — Plant Species Image Classification  Using Teachable Machine

A. Project Overview
This project presents an image classification model developed to recognize 20 distinct plant species. Utilizing a dataset of 5,120 images, the model was trained to differentiate among various plant morphological features, including structural characteristics, leaf patterns, and color variations. The system is intended to support gardeners and botany students in the efficient identification of common ornamental and wild plant species.
