# Plant-Species-Images-Classification Laboratory Work 2-A Activity 
Plant Species Image Classification Using Teachable Machine

A. Project Overview This project presents an image classification model developed to recognize 20 distinct plant species. Utilizing a dataset of 5,120 images, the model was trained to differentiate among various plant morphological features, including structural characteristics, leaf patterns, and color variations. The system is intended to support gardeners and botany students in the efficient identification of common ornamental and wild plant species.
